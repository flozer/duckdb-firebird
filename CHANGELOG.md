# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Read `INT128`, `NUMERIC(19+)`, `DECFLOAT`, `TIMESTAMP`/`TIME WITH TIME ZONE`
  and `BOOLEAN` correctly from servers with `DataTypeCompatibility = 3.0`
  or `2.5`. Before, `INT128` and `BOOLEAN` raised a DuckDB `INTERNAL Error`,
  which invalidates the database instance, and the time zone types came
  back shifted or garbled without an error. The extension now asks for the
  native types on every attachment (`isc_dpb_set_bind`).

## [v1.3.1] - 2026-10-26

Patch release completing DuckDB v2.0 compatibility. No SQL functions,
parameters, or default behavior were added or changed.

### Fixed

- Recognize DuckDB v2.0's normalized `NOT IN` expression
  (`OPERATOR_NOT` around `COMPARE_IN`) in the complex-filter pushdown hook.
- Restore remote `NOT IN` pushdown, NONE-column residual telemetry, and
  `firebird_unpushed_mode` guards on DuckDB v2.0.
- Update lambda syntax in five test assertions so the same suite runs on
  DuckDB v1.5.6 and v2.0.
- Require all four release-asset builds; DuckDB v2 artifacts can no longer
  fail without failing the release workflow.

### Validated

- DuckDB v1.5.6: 26/26 test files, 1,082 assertions on Windows with
  Firebird 5.0.3.
- DuckDB v2.0.0: 26/26 test files, 1,082 assertions on Windows with
  Firebird 5.0.3.
- EMPLOYEE smoke test passed on both DuckDB lines: native ATTACH, scan,
  metadata discovery, and telemetry.

### Downloads

Linux x64 and Windows x64 packages are provided separately for DuckDB
v1.5.6+ and DuckDB v2.0+ (`-duckdb2` suffix).
